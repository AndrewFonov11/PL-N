========== PL-N 1.0.x ========== MANUAL ============

Hmm... Where to start?

Let's start learning PL-N!

PL-N - This is a minimalist programming language, the syntax of which consists mainly of symbols. In this respect, it is somewhat similar to Brainfuck, but it should not be associated with it, since PL-N uses different symbols, has more capabilities, uses different algorithms and has different limitations.

The interpreter for this programming language is released into the public domain under CC0.

Let's start learning the basics of PL-N.

Let's write a simple program that will display a character on the screen.

Code-
+++++#{/++++++*-}/p

Don't understand anything? Don't worry.

Meaning of symbols in PL-N:
+ - increase the value of the current cell.
- - same as above, but decrease.
/ - go to the next cell.
* - go to the previous cell.
p - display the symbol that corresponds to the code of the current cell.
i - enter the symbol into the cell.
# - multiply the value of the cell by 2.
^ - reset the current cell.
! - reset all cells.
( - start the main loop (it will continue until the very first cell is = 0).
) - end of the main loop.
{ - start "loop-loop" (works almost the same as the main loop, but starting with the interpreter version 1.0.2 this type of loop checks the current cell at the start of the loop, if it is equal to 0, then the loop ends).
} - end of "loop-loop".
= - compares the current cell with the next cell after the current one, if they are equal, the value of the previous (relative to the current) cell is increased (this mechanic was introduced in the interpreter version 1.0.2).
< - same, but now the operation is if the current cell<next.
> - same, but now the operation is if the current cell>next.
e - end of the program.

A memory cell is a "container" that stores a numeric value. There can be 999999 such cells in PL-N.

In the 1.0.1 version of the interpreter, a bug was fixed where the .exe file did not start well. However, it also slightly changed the memory cell limit, now the limit is 99999.

This set of commands should be enough for you to write any algorithm.

Good luck! :)

If pl-n.exe does not start, I advise you to compile it yourself from the source code (file pl-n.c)
